- **Name**: Suhani Gupta  
- **Course**: B.Sc. CSDA  
- **Project**: Problem 1 – Student Marks and Grade Summary  
- **Date**: 05-08-2025

## 🎯 Objective

To design a Python program that:

- Takes input for student names and their marks in 3 subjects.
- Calculates total and average marks.
- Assigns grades based on average.
- Displays each student’s summary.
- Computes the class average and identifies the topper.

## 📝 Input Format

Each student record includes:
- Name (string)
- Marks in 3 subjects (integer or float)

## 📤 Output Includes

- Total and average marks per student
- Grade (A+, A, B, C, D, F)
- Class average
- Topper’s name and score

## 🧠 Grade Assignment Logic

| Average Marks | Grade |
|---------------|--------|
| 90 – 100      | A+     |
| 80 – 89       | A      |
| 70 – 79       | B      |
| 60 – 69       | C      |
| 50 – 59       | D      |
| Below 50      | F      |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Core programming concepts (functions, loops, conditionals)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)

## 💻 Sample Output
